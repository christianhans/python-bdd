==========

Python-BDD is an advanced Binary Decision Tree (BDD) library for Python.

BDDs can either be constructed by specifying a boolean function or leaf values in the constructor. The function eval() evaluates the tree for a certain variable assignment.  

It is possible to compress trees using reduce() and to combine two BDDs with boolean functions using apply(). BDDs can also be compared using Python's normal compare operator ==. Python's length function len() is also supported and returns the number of vertices. Further more BDDs have a string representation for visualation of trees using Python's print function.
